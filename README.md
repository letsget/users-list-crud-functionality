## CRUD functionality

### I was taked with creating an app with full CRUD functionality mainly:
- Fetching users from a given API
- Getting a Token
- Ability for a new user to register
- Storing a token in local Storage (although some say, it's a bad idea...)
- Ability to edit a user
- Ability to set the user as inactive, rather than deleting him
- Ability to delete a user

The App is in progress. Check back when it's fully complete.
